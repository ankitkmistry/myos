# This is the myos repository. 
This is the repository for first test of my [Skyar OS](https://ankitkmistry.github.io/myos/). Soon, this can be commercial software but till now it is open-source

# How to run the OS ??

Assuming you have installed GNU ```g++```, ```ld```, ```make``` and VirtualBox and working in a Linux Environment. You have to execute make from the terminal

```
$ make
```

The ```.bin``` and ```.iso``` files will be provided later after the development completes.
